            <h4 style="font-size: 15px;">Thank you for your interest in TeCanal.
            
            <br><br>Three years ago, TeCanal was founded with the mission of using technology and STEM education to empower youth in low-income communities. Today, TeCanal serves over seventy children in some of the most impoverished communities in Maryland each year. 
            
            <br><br>TeCanal is looking for new executive officers to lead TeCanal during the 2018-2019 academic year. You must be a rising sophomore, junior, or senior in high school to apply. All executive officers will be expected to volunteer at outreach sessions in Baltimore, MD regularly. Additionally, executive officers will have meetings at least twice a month. Some of these will be online, and some of these will be in-person in Howard County, MD. 
            
            <br><br>We sincerely hope to appoint a new suite of executive officers who believe in the power of technology and STEM education in making our world a better place. Our vision is a world where everyone has the technology resources and STEM education they need to achieve their potential. We encourage you to be part of our next generation of leaders and help make TeCanal's vision come true!
            
            <br><br>Applications will close on <b><i>Friday, May 25 at 11:59 PM.</i></b> Late applications will not be accepted.
            
            <br><br>If you have any questions about the application or TeCanal in general, please email <a href="mailto:application@tecanal.org">application@tecanal.org</a>. A member of the board of directors will reply as soon as possible.
